    <h1>Position Property</h1>
    <section>
        <p>
            The CSS position property gives us alternate rules for positioning elements. If no position property is declared, it would
            be the default position which is static. There are four different positioning properties (<span class="highlight">static</span>,
            <span class="highlight">relative</span>, <span class="highlight">absolute</span>, and <span class="highlight">fixed</span>)
            and along with them you can use the properties of top, right, bottom, and/or left to set the position values.
        </p>
        <h2>Static</h2>
        <p>
            The default position for all elements. Means the element is not positioned and falls in the natural flow of the document.
        </p>
        <div class="box">
            <p class="box-paragraph">
                I am a static box
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            This static div has no position property and is considered static. It falls where it would naturally go.
        </p>
        <h2>Relative</h2>
        <p>
            Uses the properties, top, right, bottom, or left along with an amount (positive or negative) value to offset the element
            from where it naturally occurs in the document, making it relative to it's original, static position. The surrounding
            elements are not affected at all, and sometimes they overlap.
        </p>
        <div class="relative box">
            <p class="box-paragraph">
                I am a relative box
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            This relative div has a relative position and a top value of 40px and a left value of 20px. That moves it down 40px and to
            the right 20px from where it would have been positioned.
        </p>
        <img src="img/relative-code.png" alt="CSS code for relative position">
        <h2>Absolute</h2>
        <p>
            The element this is applied to is then removed from the document flow and placed exactly where you specify it to go. Again,
            use top, right, bottom, or left properties. It is relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. If it has no positioned
            ancestors, it’s positioned relative to the body of the document.
        </p>
        <div class="absolute box">
            <p class="box-paragraph">
                I am a static box now. Make me absolute.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            The above box has no relative parent. Therefore it will be offset with respect to the body when positioned absolutely.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the element has been positioned absolutely it's taken out of the flow of the document and it doesn't leave a gap or
            space in it's original position. It also doesn't affect the flow of subsequent items.
        </p>
        <img src="img/absolute-code.png" alt="CSS code for absolute position">
        <h3>Relative + Position Absolute</h3>
        <p>
            If you set a position relative to a parent element, and a position absolute to a child element, that child element’s position
            is absolute within the parent element.
        </p>
        <div class="relative-2 box">
            <p class="box-paragraph">
                I am a relative box
            </p>
            <div class="absolute-2 box">
                <p class="box-paragraph">I am a absolute box within a relative container.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            If the first box's position was <span class="italicized">position: static;</span> its absolutely positioned child
            would escape and would be positioned relative to the document body.
        </p>
        <img src="img/relative-absolute-code.png" alt="CSS code for absolute position in a relative container">
        <h2>Fixed</h2>
        <p>
            If an element positioned fixed, it will be relative to the viewport and will always stay in the same place, even when the
            page is scrolled. Properties top, right, bottom, and left are used.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like absolute positioning, fixed positioning takes the element out of the documnet flow and don't leave a space where it
            would have been. So, if you use a fixed header or footer make sure to leave room for it. Put a margin on the
            container or body.
        </p>
        <div class="fixed box">
            <p class="box-paragraph">
                I am a static box. Make me fixed.
            </p>
        </div>
        <img src="img/fixed-code.png" alt="CSS code for fixed position">
        <p>
            Fixed position with mobile browsers can be buggy.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>- in iOS Safari 5-7, position:fixed will move to center of window with focus event on child text input field.</li>
            <li>- In Android 4.0-4.3 position:fixed inside an iframe will cause unexpected behavior.</li>
