            <div class="col">
                <p>The above round logo is part of the header. In order to extend outside the header we need to give it a position
                    of absolute. However, we want it’s absolute position to be relative to the header itself. Therefore we
                    need to give the header the position relative. If we didn’t give the header a position of relative, the
                    round logo would be positioned offset from the body of the document.</p>
                <p>Now that the round logo is bumped down, slightly out of the header, it is moved from the document flow and
                    will overlap our main content. Therefore we need to make sure to give our main content enough top margin
                    to accommodate the overlapping round logo. </p>

            <div class="col">
                <p>These two columns are floating beside each other. They are here to give you more practice with your floats.
                    Each column is half the size of the 960px website. They both have some padding on their left and right
                    sides so that the text is not flush with the column edges. They have 20px on the left side, and 20px
                    on the right side.</p>
                <p>Also give the columns a min-height so the background colors are the same height.</p>
                <p>Below these columns are three boxes. They are each 150px by 150px. Move them relatively from their original
                    position.
                </p>
                <p>At the bottom we have a footer with a 1px border. Make that one fixed so that it stays on the sceen as you
                    scroll.
