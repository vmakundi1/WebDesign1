          <h2>About this website</h2>
          <p>I have experienced a close encounter with a green mamba five years ago in my home city of Dar-es-Salaam,
            Tanzania
            Luckily, I survived the encounter. Both me and the snake (yes snakes are living creatures) were unharmed. Ever since that day,
            i have been fascinated to understand these creatures. I am a huge fan of National Geographic show 'Snake In The City'. The show covers two snake experts who are 
            '911' respondents for people who encounter snakes at home or work. It is based in the city of Durban, South Africa. Surprisingly, encounters with mambas are some of the most common reported incidents.

          <h2>Nature has a purpose</h2>
          <p>As scary as these creatures are, they are important part of the ecosystem. Both of animals prey on
            creatures like bats and rodents which are known to be carrying many organisms dangerous
            to human being.

          <h2>Black Mamba</h2>
          <p>The black mamba is a large, extremely venomous snake. It is native to parts of sub-saharan Africa.
            It is the second longest venomous snake after the king cobra. Mature mambas can grow up to more than 7 feet
            long.
            It gets its name from its black ink like mouth. The snake lives in both trees and on the ground. Over
            suitable surface, it can move at speeds up to 10 mph for short distances.

            If threatened or cornered; the mamba usually gives a warning by opening its mouth and hissing sound while
            spreading its narrow neck-flap. It can strike at considerable range and may deliver multiple bites.
            Its venom can kill a full grown human being within 10 minutes. It is known as a formidable and highly
            aggressive species.

          <h2>Green Mamba</h2>
          <p>It is a highly venomous snake that can grow over 2 feet, slightly less than its black cousin.
            A more shy species, rarely seen but with a highly venomous poison that can quickly be fatal if untreated
            early.
            In some cases, wounds from green mamba bites are said to be treated like cancer wounds.background-img

            It gets its name from black inky mouth and a slender build with bright green body colour. This coloration
            blends with its environment, hence, making it easy to hide while preying birds, eggs, bats and rodents.

          <h2>Climate change and Human activities impact</h2>
          <p>The impact of climate change cannot be underestimated. Due to deforestation to make way for agriculture and
            human settlements; many of these creatures are losing their habitat.
            This has led to many dangerous encounters with people.
